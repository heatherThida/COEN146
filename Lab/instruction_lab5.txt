# Stop and Go Packet Transfer

# Overview

In this section, describe what you did in this lab and how you accomplished it.
This lab goal is to implement a partial TCP implementation by keep transferring messages until we get a FIN packet. We identify each packet and ensure FIFO ordering as well as ensuring the correctness of the message to act as TCP.
The flow of the lab is as follow:

I. TCP emulation 
- transfer packets as strings by sevializing into Json
what does a packet look like
checksum = sum of ascii chars in message 
sequence a number 

                   packet["message"]=message["message"].upper()
