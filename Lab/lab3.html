    <h4 class="section-header"> Introduction </h4>

    <p>
    In this lab, you're going to transfer data via datagrams. So we'll create  <strong> UDP </strong>
 socket and transfer data arbitrarily. You'll be using Python to create a
 simple socket program. There are two parts to this program. The Client 
will open and read a file and transfer it line by line to your Server. 
You should first transfer over a new file name and then transfer over 
the actual data. You can think of the new file name as a sort of 
preamble or metadata about the file you'll be transferring.
    </p>

    <p>
    The frustrating piece of this lab is realizing that you have to 
Google or search the Linux man pages for just about everything. You 
won't know what the heck you're actually doing until you finish the lab.
 That's okay. You should ask all the questions you need to when you demo
 to me. If you need help, please don't waste your time waiting for me to
 come around. Just about everyone will need help so this lab will take a
 while. I've listed <a href="#resources">helpful resources</a> at the bottom of this page. When you ask me a question though, I'll ask you for the sources you've already consulted.
    </p>

    <h4 class="section-header"> Procedure </h4>

    <h6 class="subsection-header"> 1. Creating the server </h6>

    <p>
    So the server is pretty interesting. A thing to note, we'll create a
 very insecure server that just keeps listening for messages. This means
 that if you're really mean you can interrupt your friends' programs and
 mess with them.
    <br><br>
    For the purposes of this lab, we first expect a datagram which 
contains a filename. Once you receive this, you should open a file for 
writing. Then you just keep waiting until the client sends you a 
message. Everytime you receive a message, you write it out to the file 
and wait for the next one. One interestig thing is that you should 
decode all your data as ascii. This will ensure you can properly write 
out to the file.
    </p>


    <p> Here's an outline of what you'll need to do to connect to the server:
    </p><ol class="ordered-list">
      <li> Create a socket object given the proper socket specifications. </li>
      <li> Bind the socket object to your localhost and port </li>
      <li> Receive a filename and open a file </li>
      <li> Poll for all the data that should go into the file </li>
      <li> Close the socket </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>

    <h6 class="subsection-header"> 2. Creating the client </h6>

    <p>
    The client should take in the server's hostname and the file name to transfer as command line arguments <strong>argv</strong>.
 Your client should first send the file name to the server and then it 
should send the data line by line, encoding it as ascii. In order for 
these the client to communicate with the server, it needs to know <strong> the hostname </strong> and <strong> the port number </strong>.
 So it's your job to figure out what the hostname for your machine is. 
You will be assigned a port number at the beginning of lab.
    <br><br>
    This process is reflective of the actual process of making a 
connection when you access Google. We get the hostname and the port, 
throw in some routing business and you've got a connection.
    </p>

    <p> Here's an outline of what you'll need to do to connect to the server:
    </p><ol class="ordered-list">
      <li> Resolve the IP Address given the hostname and the port number </li>
      <li> Create a socket object with the proper socket specifications. </li>
      <li> Send over a new file name </li>
      <li> Open the file to transfer and start sending data using the created socket object </li>
      <li> At the end, you should send a control message, just an empty string to notify the end of file </li>
      <li> Close the socket </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>

    <p>
    I know, I make it seem so simple and it really isn't. Thankfully, in
 the next section, I've outlined and given you a couple of functions to 
read through.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that there is more than one way to start sending data. You'll
 find that there are two functions, sendto() and send(). You should look
 up the ways in which we use each one. They'll accomplish the same goal,
 but one requires a little more set up.
    </p>


    <h4 class="section-header"> My Kinda Helpful Guidance  </h4>

    <p class="warning">
    If you ask me about the functions, I'll ask you a question about the
 man pages before I answer you. Looking up documentation is a skill that
 you need to learn, so just read the man pages before asking me 
questions.
    </p>

    <p>
    So there are five different "coordinates" you need to specify for a socket:
    </p>

    <pre class=" language-python">    <code class=" language-python">
        Address Family <span class="token operator">-</span> What type of address are you trying to find<span class="token punctuation">,</span> IPv4<span class="token punctuation">,</span> IPv6<span class="token punctuation">.</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>For this lab we use IPv4<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
        Socket Type <span class="token operator">-</span> What sorts of messages are you sending
        Protocol <span class="token operator">-</span> You won<span class="token string">'t really wory about this, it'</span>s just further specification
        Address <span class="token operator">-</span> The address you're connecting to
        Port <span class="token operator">-</span> The port number you're connecting to
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
    Here's a high level overview of useful functions for this lab. 
Anything that begins with socket. means it's static socket library 
function. Anything that begins with sock. is a method to be called on a 
socket object.

    <h4 class="section-header"> Submission Guidelines </h4>

    <p>
    Because I know you can find all the code for this online, you have 
to answer a couple questions, these can all be found in the report 
template (which is in Markdown format). You can open it in VI or any 
normal text editor. You should 3 files named in the following way:
    </p>

    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li> client.py - which contains your client code </li>
      <li> server.py - which contains your server code </li>
      <li> report.md - report grabbed from the temmplate </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    You should then create a zip file containing all three files. In the
 end, you submit the zip file. Here's some math to help you out. I have 3
 files. I combine them into one by making a zipfile. I then upload JUST 
the zipfile to Camino (whenever it comes back up).
    </p>

    <h4 class="section-header"> Tips </h4>

    <h6 class="subsection-header">  1. Port Numbers </h6>

    <p>
    To eliminate a source of bugs, please use the assigned port numbers.
 This will alleviate a certain class of bugs. Everyone will get their 
own, you're welcome to see what happens when you and someone else have 
the same port number.
    </p>

    <h6 class="subsection-header">  2. Hostnames </h6>

    <p>
    You can find out the proper hostname by one of the three following methods.
    </p>

    <ol class="ordered-list">

      <li>
      The hostname should be specified on the command line as <strong>linux608xx</strong>. Replace the <strong>xx</strong> with  the specific machine number.
      </li>

      <li>
      The hostname of the machine can also be found on the command line after your user name.
      </li>

      <li>
      You can also just use the string "localhost"
      </li>

    </ol>

    Note that this is not valid Python code. A lot of the syntax is correct, but not everything.
